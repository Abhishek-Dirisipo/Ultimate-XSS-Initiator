CEH practical  tips 


## ———1——— scan & identify FQDN 
To perform an extensive scan of the target network and identify the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the Domain Controller, you can use various network scanning tools and techniques. Here's a general approach you can follow:

1. **Network Discovery**: Start by performing network discovery to identify live hosts and active services on the target network. Tools like Nmap, Netdiscover, or Angry IP Scanner can be helpful for this purpose. Use the following command with Nmap to scan the network for live hosts:

    ```
    nmap -sn <target_network>
    ```

2. **Port Scanning**: Once you have identified live hosts, perform port scanning to find open ports and services running on those hosts. Use Nmap for this step as well. The following command will perform a TCP SYN scan on the target network:

    ```
    nmap -sS -p- <target_network>
    ```

3. **Service Enumeration**: After identifying open ports, use Nmap or other tools to enumerate services running on those ports. This will help you identify services that might be associated with a Domain Controller. For example, you might look for ports commonly used by Active Directory services (e.g., TCP ports 389, 636, 3268, 3269).

    ```
    nmap -p <ports> --script=smb-enum-services <target>
    ```

4. **Active Directory Enumeration**: Once you suspect you've found a Domain Controller, you can use tools like enum4linux, ldapsearch, or smbclient to further enumerate Active Directory information, including the FQDN of the Domain Controller.

    ```
    enum4linux -a <target>
    ```

    ```
    ldapsearch -h <domain_controller_ip> -x -b '' -s base namingcontexts
    ```

5. **Review Results**: Analyze the results of your scans and enumeration to identify the FQDN of the Domain Controller. Look for entries related to domain controllers, such as DNS records or service banners.

6. **Verify**: Once you've identified a potential Domain Controller, you can verify its FQDN by performing additional checks, such as DNS resolution or querying the Domain Controller itself.

Remember to always conduct these scans and tests responsibly and with proper authorization. Unauthorized scanning of networks is illegal and unethical. Make sure you have permission before performing any scanning activities on a network.


## ———2——— find wampserver
To identify the IP address of the server running WampServer on the target network after an attack, you'll need to perform scanning and service enumeration specifically targeting Windows web development environments. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach this task:

1. **Network Discovery**: Start by identifying live hosts on the target network. You can use tools like Nmap, Angry IP Scanner, or Netdiscover for this purpose. Run a basic ping scan to identify live hosts:

    ```
    nmap -sn <target_network>
    ```

2. **Port Scanning**: Once you have identified live hosts, perform port scanning to find open ports and services running on those hosts. Focus on common ports associated with web development environments such as HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443). Use Nmap for this purpose:

    ```
    nmap -p 80,443 <target>
    ```

3. **Service Enumeration**: After identifying hosts with open HTTP or HTTPS ports, you can use tools like Nmap or other HTTP enumeration tools to identify the specific web server software running on those ports. You're looking for indications of WampServer being used.

    ```
    nmap -p 80,443 --script=http-enum <target>
    ```

4. **Web Application Scanning**: If you suspect a host is running WampServer based on the HTTP service banner or other indications, you can use web application scanning tools like Nikto or OWASP ZAP to further enumerate web applications and server details.

    ```
    nikto -h <target>
    ```

5. **Analyze Results**: Review the results of your scans and enumeration to identify any servers running WampServer. Look for specific headers, response codes, or banners that indicate the presence of WampServer.

6. **Verify**: Once you've identified a potential server running WampServer, you can verify its IP address by performing additional checks, such as manual inspection of the server or querying the network infrastructure for assigned IP addresses.

Remember to always conduct these scans and tests ethically and with proper authorization. Unauthorized scanning of networks is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have permission before performing any scanning activities on a network.

    ```
    hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt smb://<target_ip>
    ```

    Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the machine identified in the previous step. Replace `users.txt` and `passwords.txt` with the respective files containing user and password lists.

3. **Access SMB Share**: Once you've obtained the credentials for user Henry, you can access the SMB share on the target machine using tools like smbclient or mounting the share as a network drive in Windows.

    ```
    smbclient //<target_ip>/share_name -U Henry
    ```

4. **Retrieve and Decrypt Sniff.txt**: After accessing the SMB share, locate and download the Sniff.txt file. Once you have the file, you'll need to decrypt it using Henry's password. The decryption process will depend on the encryption method used for the Sniff.txt file.

5. **Decrypt Sniff.txt**: Since you mentioned using Henry's password to decode the text, I assume the text is encrypted using a simple encoding method. You can use tools like base64 decode or XOR decryption with Henry's password to decrypt the text.

6. **Enter Decrypted Text**: After decrypting the Sniff.txt file using Henry's password, you'll obtain the decoded secret. Enter the decrypted text as the answer.

3. **Identify Encryption Type**: Determine the encryption type used by the Wi-Fi network. Common encryption types include WEP, WPA, and WPA2.

4. **Crack the Password**: Use Aircrack-ng to crack the Wi-Fi password based on the encryption type. The exact command will depend on the encryption type and other factors such as the presence of a handshake capture. For example, to crack a WPA/WPA2 password with a captured handshake, you might use a command like:

   ```
   aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b <BSSID> Wireless\ Capture.cap
   ```

   Replace `<BSSID>` with the MAC address of the access point and `wordlist.txt` with a wordlist containing potential passwords.

5. **Wait for Successful Crack**: Aircrack-ng will attempt to crack the Wi-Fi password by testing combinations from the provided wordlist. Depending on the complexity of the password and the computational resources available, this process may take some time.

6. **Retrieve Password**: Once Aircrack-ng successfully cracks the Wi-Fi password, it will display the password on the screen.

7. **Provide Password**: Enter the cracked Wi-Fi password as the answer to the question.

Ensure that you have explicit authorization to perform these actions and that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized access to networks or systems is illegal and unethical. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any security testing.

## ——19—— remote access for administration purpose , the windows 

Since physical access to the target machine is not possible, and assuming you have proper authorization to perform this task, you can attempt to remotely access the Windows machine in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet and retrieve the "sa_code.txt" file using various remote access methods. Here's a general approach:

1. **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: If Remote Desktop is enabled on the target Windows machine and you have the necessary credentials, you can use an RDP client like Remote Desktop Connection (built into Windows) or a third-party RDP client to connect remotely. Once connected, navigate to the file location and retrieve the "sa_code.txt" file.

2. **Secure Shell (SSH)**: If the target Windows machine has an SSH server installed and configured, you can use an SSH client like PuTTY to establish a secure shell connection remotely. Navigate to the file location and use command-line tools like `scp` (secure copy) to transfer the "sa_code.txt" file from the remote machine to your local machine.

3. **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: If an FTP server is running on the target Windows machine and you have valid FTP credentials, you can use an FTP client like FileZilla to connect remotely. Once connected, navigate to the file location and download the "sa_code.txt" file.

4. **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**: If you have administrative access to the Windows machine and WMI is enabled, you can use WMI commands or scripts to remotely access and retrieve files from the target machine.

5. **PowerShell Remoting**: If PowerShell remoting is enabled on the target Windows machine, you can use PowerShell cmdlets like `Copy-Item` to remotely copy files from the target machine to your local machine.

Once you have successfully retrieved the "sa_code.txt" file from the target machine using any of the above methods, open the file and retrieve the string inside. Enter this string as the answer to the question.

Always ensure that you have proper authorization and permission to perform remote access tasks on target machines. Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical.


## ——20—VeraCrypt

To decrypt the hashed password in the "Key2Secret.txt" file and access the VeraCrypt volume on the "EH Workstation - 2" machine, then find the secret code in the "Confidential.txt" file, follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve Hashed Password**: Access the "Key2Secret.txt" file located in the Documents folder of the "EH Workstation - 1" (ParrotSecurity) machine. Copy the hashed password from the file.

2. **Hash Decryption**: Use a password cracking tool like John the Ripper, Hashcat, or online services to decrypt the hashed password. You may need to use a wordlist or a brute-force attack depending on the complexity of the password.

3. **Mount VeraCrypt Volume**: Once you have the decrypted password, transfer it to the "EH Workstation - 2" machine. Use VeraCrypt to mount the "Secret" volume file located on the C: drive of the workstation. Provide the decrypted password when prompted.

4. **Access Confidential Data**: After successfully mounting the VeraCrypt volume, navigate to the mounted volume and locate the "Confidential.txt" file. Open the file to access the secret code contained within.

5. **Retrieve Secret Code**: Retrieve the secret code from the "Confidential.txt" file. This code is the company's trade secret that was encrypted using VeraCrypt.

6. **Provide Secret Code**: Enter the secret code as the answer to the question.

Ensure that you have proper authorization to access and decrypt the files, as well as to retrieve the secret code. Unauthorized access to encrypted data or trade secrets is illegal and unethical. Always conduct such activities within the bounds of legality and with explicit permission from the organization.
